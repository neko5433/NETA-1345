<h1>Easy Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</h1>
<img src="https://thebigmansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/single-serve-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe-500x500.jpg">
<h2>instructions</h2>
<p>To make these delicious chocolate chip cookies, start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Melt ½ cup of butter in the microwave for about 40 seconds, making sure it’s melted but not hot. In a large bowl, combine the butter with ½ cup of granulated sugar and ¼ cup of packed brown sugar until smooth, then stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1 large egg. Add 1 ¾ cups of properly measured all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt, mixing until just combined into a soft, slightly sticky dough. Gently fold in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips, then scoop out about 1.5 tablespoons of dough for each cookie, placing them 2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake for 7–10 minutes, until the cookies are set and slightly puffy, with the centers looking a little underbaked for a soft, chewy texture.
